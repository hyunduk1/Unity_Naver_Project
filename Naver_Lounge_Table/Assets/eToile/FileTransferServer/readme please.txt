Hi, first of all: thank you for purchasing FileTransferServer.
I'm sure it will make your developer's life easier.

Then: Before start with the application, please extract the "ExtractMeToStreamingAssets.zip" file into the "StreamingAssets" folder.
The "StreamingAssets" folder is a special Unity fodler. It must be right in the "Assets" folder, otherwise Unity will not find it.

If you see a lot of errors when opening for first time, that should be that you are using the wrong platform.
So to fix it you must open your "BuildSettings" dialog and chose any supported platform.

Please take a look at the documentation, it will answer most of your questions.

Thanks again.
